# mvc-tech-blog
Tech blog for week 14 challenge


## Description

Sometimes discussing technology can be as crucial as developing it. Often times developers dedicate a large portion of their time crafting new applications and refining current codebases. I wanted to create a blog where they could allocate a portion of their time to studying and articulating their own technical ideas, recent progressions, and emerging technologies with others in the industry. A quick online search on any topic within this course yields numerous articles and tutorials authored by developers spanning various levels of expertise!

My goal in the future is to have a blog where developers can publish whatever they are currently working on in the industry and comment on other developers' posts as well. To be more of a one stop site for developers to interact all in one place. The general development of this app was to follow the MVC paradigm structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language and Sequelize as the ORM.

## Installation

The application is deployed with Heroku and can be found here => [MVC Tech Blog](https://git.heroku.com/glacial-crag-37615.git)
To see all that went into this project you can find my GitHub Repo here => [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ZBurnell/mvc-tech-blog)

   
## Usage

This application is deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com). However there is still work that needs done before it is able to be used. 


## Credits
  
To start the file layout I used everything I learned about MVC's from the OSU Bootcamp lessons. Additional information was gatehered from the OSU-VIRT-FSF-PT-08-2023-U-LOLC repo. I also utilized the Xpert Learning Assistant and Stack over flow documents when additional information not provided in class was needed.
